# 🛠 Skill Development Projects  

### **1. Website Product Category Classification (Playwright + GPT-4)**  
**Tech:** Python, Playwright, asyncio, Google Sheets API, GPT-4  
**Description:**  
Automated system that visits e-commerce websites, extracts metadata, and classifies each website into one of four product categories:  
- Clothing + Shoes (9)  
- Clothing (8)  
- Shoes (7)  
- Lingerie (6)

**Highlights:**  
- Uses Playwright to load websites and bypass pop-ups, language selectors, cookie banners  
- Extracts metadata (meta tags, titles, headers, category links)  
- English websites use rule-based classification  
- Non-English websites use GPT-4 classification  
- Updates results back to Google Sheets  
- Tracks errors, tokens used, and API cost

### **2. Data Transformation & Analytics using DBT + DuckDB**  
**Tech:** dbt, DuckDB, SQL  
**Highlights:**  
- Built SQL transformation models using dbt  
- Organized raw → intermediate → analytics layers  
- Performed downstream analysis in DuckDB  
- Demonstrated data pipeline building & modeling skills
